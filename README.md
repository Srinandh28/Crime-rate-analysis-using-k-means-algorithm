# Overview
This project is a simple overview of the demonstration features in RStudio. Through the graphs plotted with the datsaset, an analysis is performed to compare the crime rate in various regions of the United States.
Different types of crimes are compared to each other to determine the prevalent type of crime in that region.
The csv file is provided in the repository along with the program.
